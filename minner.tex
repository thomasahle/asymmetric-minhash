%Mining, Inference, and Learning: These topics are the kernel of knowledge discovery from databases (KDD) paradigm and continue to witness massive growth. While classical aspects of supervised learning have been mainstreamed into the development cycle, new variations on unsupervised learning like self-supervision, few shot learning, prescriptive learning (reinforcement learning), transfer learning, meta learning, and representational learning are pushing the research boundary in a world where the proportion of labeled and annotated data is becoming minuscule.
% In each of these topics, we seek submissions that highlight the trade-off between accuracy, stability, robustness, and efficiency.
% Submissions that propose “new” inference tasks are strongly encouraged.
